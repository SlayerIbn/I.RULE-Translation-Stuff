Repository to help people in their translations for I.RULE.


This stuff is ready to work with UndertaleModTool.

Here's the download link of UMT (I highly recommend 0.4.0.1 version than others). https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/releases

And here's a basic tutorial videos list for UMT (the video version is 0.3.0 so maybe there are differences between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0.1 versions). https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQRb8TMW7tK02ZYSYdXpLXsmP8OXJAVx

Lang.txt is the file that you have to translate if you wanna start with your translation.

This files are ready to use with I.RULE 0.1.8.1 version.
